I am a psychologist with offices in Palo Alto, and San Francisco.  I have been a practicing therapist for 16 years, after receiving a Ph.D. from UCLA in Psychology.  I specialize in helping people overcome depression, fears and anxieties, and relationship issues, and I enjoy working with both adults and children, as well as couples. My standard fee is $220 per session. Although I am not within network for any insurance carriers, I will provide you with all the documentation necessary to obtain reimbursement if your plan has that option. <a href="/spanish.html">Se habla Espa√±ol</a>.
