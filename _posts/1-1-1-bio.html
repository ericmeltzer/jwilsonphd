I am a psychologist with offices in Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and San Francisco, with a diverse practice.  I've been a practicing therapist for 16 years, after receiving a Ph.D. from UCLA in Psychology.  I specialize in helping people overcome depression, fears and anxieties, and relationship issues, and I enjoy working with both individuals and couples, as well as families. I charge between 130 and 160 dollars per session. <a href="/spanish.html">Yo hablo Espa√±ol</a>.  If you would like to make an appointment, or have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.  I have a <a href="/qa.html">Q&A page</a> here.
